## 🌟 About Me
Hello! I’m Qiwei Liang (梁棋炜), a senior undergraduate student majoring in Robotics Engineering at Shenzhen University, expected to graduate in July 2026. Currently, I am conducting research at the Humanoid Computing Lab, HKUST(gz), under the supervision of Renjing Xu. Previously, I conducted research at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Shenzhen MSU-BIT University, under the supervision of Runhao Zeng.

Before diving into research, I was an IoT enthusiast dedicated to developing IoT products with the goal of improving people’s lives. I was also the national champion, of the China Collegiate IoT Design Competition.

My research interests lie in Embodied AI, particularly in Robotic Manipulation (VLA, VA, RL), Robot Learning, and Whole-Body Control. Fundamentally, my work revolves around infusing intelligence into machines. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
